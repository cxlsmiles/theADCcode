2006-09-06  Vysotskiy Vitja  <vitjaphen@ngs.ru>
	
	* interface to MOLCAS v6.* was done
	* more output in debugging mode 
	* added support for x86_64 
	* automatically working with include files of MOLCAS
	
2004-12-06  Alex Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Part of Patch 0.10.1
	One-electron Hamiltonian.
	
	* phis_mc_oneel.f: New file. Very similar to the implementation of
	the other one-electron properties.
	* molcas.h: Updated accordingly.
	* m_init.c: Likewise.
	* Makefile.in: Likewise.	

2004-06-17  Alex Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Part of Patch 0.9.1
	Quadrupol integrals.

	* phis_mc_quad.c: New file. Straightforward implementation similar
	to the dipol integrals.
	* molcas.h: Updated accordingly.
	* m_init.c: Likewise.
	* Makefile.in: Likewise.
	
2004-05-05  Alex Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Patch 0.8.3
	Bugfixes for the new one-electron transformation.
	The INPORB file stores as many SCF vectors as there are basis
	functions, i.e. including those that have been deleted due to
	linear dependencies. The vector unblocking code was still based
	on the number of orbitals.

	* mc_one.f (mc_one_transform): Dimensions have been interchanged
	in the declaration of C, the field of SCF coefficients.
	* phis_mc_scfvec.f: Removed check for nBas != nOrb. This is really
	irrelevant here. Check for nBasSum == nAO instead.
	(mc_unblock_scfvec): Assume that there are nBas SCF orbitals instead
	of nOrb.
	(mc_transform_scfvec): Added a compile time variable to switch off
	the transformation for debugging purposes.
	(mc_read_scfvec): Fixed typo in FileName.
	Pass the right number of functions to RdVec().
	
2004-04-05  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Patch 0.8.2
	Fix transformation of one-electron matrices. 
	The SCF coefficients for this transformation were read from the
	ONEINT file before. This is inconsistent since the MOTRA program
	reads these coefficients from the INPORB file.

	* phis_mc_scfvec.f (mc_read_scfvec): Call RdVec() to read the SCF
	vectors instead of RdCom().
	* m_init.c: Overlap integrals disabled, since these are not yet
	consistent with the new SCF vectors.
	
2004-04-02  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Part of patch 0.8.1
	Implement dipol matrix elements in velocity form.

	* mc_one.f: New file, collected all the routines that are common
	to the one-electron handling here and gave them more generic names.
	The routines now take the name of the ONEINT file section as an
	argument where appropriate.
	(mc_proc_one): Moved from phis_mc_dip.f (mc_proc_dip).
	(mc_one_transform): Moved from phis_mc_dip (mc_dip_transform).
	(read_and_expand): Moved from phis_mc_dip.f.
	* phis_mc_dip.f: Modified to conform to the new ONEINT handling.
	* phis_mc_vel.f: New file, basically identical to phis_mc_dip.f.
	* Makefile.in (mc_one.o): Added.
	(phis_mc_vel.o): Added.
	* m_aux.f (mc_query_vel): New function to detect the presence of
	velocity integrals.
	* m_init.c: Hook phis_mc_vel() into the interface and set the
	capabilities accordingly.
	(mc_stop): New function to be able to terminate with EXIT_FAILURE
	from within a Fortran routine.
	* molcas.h: Updated according to the above changes.
	* test/test.pl: Call dump_out in symmetry-first and energy-first
	mode to check that all parts of PHIS can be executed.
	* test/test.0: SDipol directive added, to have at least one test
	use this new feature.
	
2004-03-31  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Part of patch 0.7.103

	* test/test.pl: Relaxed requirement on the Perl version a little.
	
2004-03-26  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Part of patch 0.7.102
	Script cleanup.

	* test/test.pl: Cleaned up the script removing some assumptions
	about the environment and making it stand-alone. Note that this
	now requires a Perl version 5.6.1 or later.
	Made the script exit if a test fails.
	* Makefile.in (test): New target, executes test/test.pl.
	(m_init.o): Dependencies on header files added.
	Removed configure stuff from the realclean and distclean.
	* molcas.h: Include config.h explicitly.
	
2004-03-25  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Patch 0.7.101
	This patchset fixes the code for the dipole integrals. They have
	been reported in the SO basis before.
	
	* phis_mc_scfvec.f: This has to be completely reworked. I start
	with some small changes to make the dipole code work.
	(mc_read_scfvec): New routine that returns the SCF vectors in
	terms of the SO basis.
	(mc_unblock_scfvec): Replaces unblock_matrix(). This routine now
	takes care of the MO part (freezing/deleting/reordering MOs) and
	leaves the vectors themselves alone.
	(mc_transform_scfvec): New routine that implements the second part
	of the obsolete unblock_matrix() routine: performs  the SO->AO
	transformation of the SCF vectors.
	(generate_SOtoAO): Added some more parameters to differentiate
	between MOs, SOs and AOs.

	* phis_mc_dip.f: Changed the code layout a bit since I need some
	additional dynamic arrays.
	(mc_proc_dip): Additional subroutine that receives the dimensions
	and dynamically declares some helper arrarys.
	(read_dip): Is moved inside mc_proc_dip() and renamed
	read_and_expand(). Also handles unblocking now.
	(copy_and_expand): Replaced by mc_dip_transform() inside
	mc_proc_dip(). 
	(mc_dip_transform): Performs the SO->MO transformation.
	
	* m_init.c: HAVE_DIP added for energy-first ordering.  Removed
	HAVE_SCFVEC at the same time since this has not been tested at
	all.
	
2004-03-22  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Part of patch 0.7.100
	Streamline configuration.
	* configure.ac: Removed.

2004-03-10  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	This patch removes the functionality to display frozen/deleted
	orbitals. Detailed changes:
	* m_aux.f (mc_setup): Always read the active orbitals from TraOne.
	(mc_maps): Never use nOrb for active orbitals.
	
2004-02-06  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	* m_aux.f (mc_maps): Bug due to improperly decared array - fixed.

2003-09-08  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	* phis_mc_overlap.f: ... this.
	* Makefile.in: Updated accordingly.
	* molcas.h: Likewise.
	* m_init.c: Likewise.

	* phis_mc_epsi.f: Use MapToExternal(), cleaned up the code.
	* phis_mc_occ.f: Likewise.
	* phis_mc_sym.f: Likewise.
	* phis_mc_nextint.f: Use MapToExternal().

2003-09-08  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	* configure.ac: Minor typo in error message fixed.

2003-06-30  Alexander Thiel  <Alexander.Thiel@tc.pci.uni-heidelberg.de>

2003-06-28  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	* phis_mc_geometry.f: Set Z_nuc to an impossible value (-1)

2003-06-04  Joerg Breidbach  <joergb@tc.pci.uni-heidelberg.de>

	* phis_mc_geometry.f (phis_mc_geometry): nuclear charges (Z_nuc)

	* molcas.fh.in (MapUnblock): Declares new common array,
	* m_aux.f: it is initialized here...

	SYM_BLOCKED flag now.
	
	* phis_mc_geometry.f: New functionality.
	* Makefile.in, molcas.h, m_init.c: Updated accordingly.

2002-11-28  Alexander Thiel  <Alexander.Thiel@tc.pci.uni-heidelberg.de>

	and nDel only.
	(m_setup): Implement support for the SHOW_INACTIVE flag: Call 
	mc_rd_traone only if this flag is not set. Use unit map otherwise.
	Note that SHOW_INACTIVE does not work with Vpqrs().

	* molcas3.f: Likewise.
	
2002-04-25  Alexander Thiel  <Alexander.Thiel@tc.pci.uni-heidelberg.de>

	* m_init.c: Likewise.
	* m_aux.f (unblock_matrix): New function.

	* molcas.h: mc_list_active added, m_get_scfvec fixed.
