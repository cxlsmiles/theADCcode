	Part of patch 0.8.1
	* test/test.pl: Call dump_out in symmetry-first and energy-first
	mode to check that all parts of PHIS can be executed.

2004-03-31  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	Patch 0.7.103
	This patch implements the dipol integrals for the GUK backend.

	* guk_read_type2.c: New file, replaces guk5_read_type2.c.
	This file hides the implementational differences between GUK
	versions 5 and 6 w.r.t. section type 2.
	* phis_guk_dip.c: New file. Reads the dipole moments and
	transforms them to the MO basis.
	* phis_guk_overlap.c: Now uses guk_read_type2(), too.
	* phis_guk_geometry.c: Use guk_read_type2() to extract the nuclear
	potential energy.
	* phis_guk_epsi.c: Likewise.
	* guk_init.c: Added phis_guk_dip() to the interface and announced
	it in the capabilities.
	(query_guk_version): New local function. Version detection now works 
	on all (known) architectures.
	(Guk_version_5): Removed. Use generic functions instead.
	* guk_aux.c (copy_and_expand): New function to expand a packed matrix
	out-of-place. Used for the one-electron matrices.
	* Makefile.in (guk5_read_type.o): Changed to guk_read_type2.o
	(phis_guk_dip.o): New entry.
	* guk.h: Protoypes added for the new fuctions.

	Part of patch 0.7.102
	Script cleanup.

	environment. The path to the GUK executable may now be given as an
	optional argument.
	Now actually compares the results and exits on failure.
	* Makefile.in: New target test, executes test/test.pl.
	Removed configure stuff from the realclean and distclean.
	
2004-03-22  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	patch. Also removes a chunk of unused code.

2004-03-11  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	This patch adds symmetry-first ordering. Detailed changes:
	* guk_init.c: Added code to reorder the active orbitals
	symmetry-first and concatenated this with the active->SCF mapping.
	This also required some reorganization of the code since I need to
	call phis_guk_sym().
	Added a few more flags to the announced capabilities in the
	SYM_BLOCKED case.

2004-03-10  Alexander Thiel  <stderr@web.de>

	This patch removes the functionality to display inactive
	orbitals. Detailed changes:
	* guk.h: Remove global variables unit_map and active_only.
	(map_to_act): Renamed to more appropriate map_active (since it
	maps _from_ active orbitals).
	* guk_init.c: Removed initialization of these variables.
	* phis_guk_info.c: Reference to active_only removed.
	* phis_guk_epsi.c: Basically reverted change from 2002-04-10.
