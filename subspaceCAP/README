To compile the CAP code: pgf90 -tp k8-32 -o cap.exe input.f90 config.f90 ADC_eigenvectors.f90 CAP_MO.f90 CAP.f90 cap_Sajeev.f r2capmat.f90 *.c main.f90 -llapack -lblas -Bstatic

What does the code do?  Computes the CAP matrix elements in AO basis and then transforms it in the MO basis.
		        Then from the ADC output and those MO-CAP matrix elements, it computes the CAP in the ADC eigenvectors basis.
                        Finally, diagonalize this matrix for several values of eta (eta being the strenght of the CAP).

What does the code need? from Gamess-US, it needs the MO coeffs in mocoef.txt, position of the atoms in xyz.txt, AO basis in capint.txt
                         from ADC, it needs the ADC eigen-values/vectors
                         from you, an input like
